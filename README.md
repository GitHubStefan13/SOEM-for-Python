# SOEM-for-Python
Simple Open Ethernet Master Module for Python


I DO NOT HAVE ANY TESTING DEVICES AT THE MOMENT THATS WHY 
THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED FOR A UNKNOWN TIME!

THE PROJECT IN ITS CURRENT FORM CONTAINS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN 
SOEM AND PYTHON BUT THE CALLS ARE NOT CORRECTLY SET UP!
CAUSING WRONG BYTES AT WRONG PLACES
